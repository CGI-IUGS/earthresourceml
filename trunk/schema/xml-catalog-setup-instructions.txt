Step 1: Set up the xml catalog located at https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/subversion/GeoSciML/trunk/schema/ (as per instructions included in that directory).

Step 2: Add the following lines of text to the "catalog.xml" file. (e.g. copy and past somewhre within the <catalog> </catalog> tags) :-



	<!-- ===================== GGIC MineralOccurrence Resources ===================== -->
	<rewriteSystem systemIdStartString="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/subversion/xmml/GGIC/trunk/schema/MineralOccurrence/1.0.0/"
		rewritePrefix="ggic.gov.au/MineralOccurrence/"/>
	<rewriteURI uriStartString="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/subversion/xmml/GGIC/trunk/schema/MineralOccurrence/1.0.0/"
		rewritePrefix="ggic.gov.au/MineralOccurrence/"/>




Step 3: Create a new directory called <CATALOG_HOME>/ggic.gov.au/MineralOccurrence/ and paste a copy of the mineralOccurrence.xsd file there.

Step 4: Use <CATALOG_HOME>/catalog.xml as the OASIS XML Catalog to validate GeoSciML and MineralOccurrence documents with.

Step 5: After any schema upgrades a copy of the mineralOccurrence.xsd file will need to be remade
