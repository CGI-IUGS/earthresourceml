MineralOccurrence 1.0.0 changes to 1.0.1

Cleaning up Names:
Changed 'RawMaterial' <<Data Type>> to 'MinedMaterial'
Changed role of 'MinedMaterial' from 'composition' to 'rawMaterial'
Changed 'MineNamePreference' to 'MineName'
 
Cardinality issues:
Cardinality of 'MiningActivity' to 'MinedMaterial' changed from 0..* to 1..1 (Each MinedMaterial may only be associated with one MiningActivity)
Changed cardinality on 'relatedMine' association to allow multiple 'relatedMines' for each 'Mine' 

Model Restructure:
Changed 'Product' from <<FeatureType>> to <<DataType>> 
Changed 'relatedMine' aggregation to a directed association (Mines need not aggregate to form other mines, they may just be associated in some way or another)
Created a new 'MiningFeature' as abstract parent feature for Mine and MiningActivity to allow specifying occurrences.
Created a 'MiningFeatureOccurrence' to allow specifying the 'location' of the 'MiningFeature'. gml:location is deprecated and so need some way to link to GM_Object.  Therefore used GeoSciML pattern.
Created 'MiningFeatureOccurrence:observationMethod' and 'MiningFeatureOccurrence:positionAccuracy' attributes as per the GeoSciML pattern. These may eventually be replaced with ISO19115 equivalents
Added association between 'MiningFeatureOccurrence' and GM_Object with role 'location'
